<h1>About the Isles</h1>

<p>Adrasteia is a Role-Playing Game, ( RPG) that focuses exclusively on the interactive, text based role play aspect of the gaming experience. Rank, status and property are acquired via role-play, rather than by statting or player vs. player interaction. The game is the result of the effort to combine the best features of free form chat based role play, with the world building and exploration potential of a traditional MUD. If you love to write and have ideas for places and characters you would love to see brought to life, this may be the game for you. Your ideas could help forge new realms in Adrasteia.</p>

She has done much of the hands on work of generating wiki content, room writing and building in the MUD and will be the primary contact for concerns regarding room edits or builds. She can be reached via game mail at the account Astra.</p>

She is a senior RP admin  with oversight of the administration of the rules and regulations of Adrasteia. Reports on glitches, bugs, and other technical malfunctions can be sent to her via game mail at the account Sela.</p>


<h3>Junior Admin</h3>

He is a junior RP admin  with oversight of the administration of the rules and regulations of Adrasteia. Requests for customization, and reports on glitches, bugs, and other technical malfunctions can be sent to him via game mail at the account Chron.</p>

<p><h4>Nox</p></h4>

<h3>Systems Consultant</h3>

<p><h4>Solaris</h4></p>

<p>A special shoutout goes to Solaris, our site sysop consultant and development partner who together with Sela and Chron, continues to help us get the most out of Adrasteia. A game developer in his own right, we are proud to be able to tip a hat in the direction of our sister site <a href="http://miithronia.com">Miithronia</a> and vouch for a story worth playing there as well.</p>

<h3>Site Moderators</h3> 

<p>All site moderators provide a point of first oversight for the administration of the rules and regulations of Adrasteia, with powers to ensure that a positive playing environment is maintained. Moderators provide guidance, support and where necessary, temporary discipline for the player base in the absence of a junior or senior admin.</p>
